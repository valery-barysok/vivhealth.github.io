                            <p><strong>HOW WE STORE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
                            <p>All your Personal Data are collected on our servers for the purposes indicated in Section 5. We host and process all your Personal Data in data hosting service providers in the United States.</p>
                            <p>We do not share your Personal Data with any third parties except as specified by this Privacy Policy. We use a couple of third-party services like Appsee to see and analyze how you navigate through the App, what features you prefer the most, and how to improve your experience with the App.</p>
                            <p>BY USING THE APP, YOU CONSENT THAT WE MAY USE COOKIES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, AND COLLECT YOUR USAGE DATA UNDER A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER, FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRACKING, ANALYSIS, AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE APP.</p>
                            <p>You may choose to share your Content using our proprietary or third-party services. Please note that any such third-party services are not governed by this Privacy Policy.

                            <p>If you choose to delete the App, we may retain your Personal data for as long as your account is active and within reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the App. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve the App. Where we retain information for App improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p>
                            <p>We take all reasonable and appropriate measures to protect all collected Personal Data from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data that we process.

                            <ol type="a" class="with-margine">
                                <li>Pseudominization and tokenization of certain categories of your Personal Data;</li>

                                <li>Organizational and legal measures. For example, our employees have different levels of access to your Personal Data and only those in charge of data management get access to your Personal Data and only for limited purposes required for the operation of the App. We impose strict liability on our employees for any disclosures, unauthorized accesses, alterations, destructions, misuses of your Personal Data.</li>
                                <li>Conducting periodical data protection impact assessments in order to ensure that the App fully adheres to the principles of 'privacy by design', 'privacy by default' and others. We also commit to undertake privacy audit in case of Company's merger or takeover.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Please understand that no security system is perfect and, as such, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the App, or that your information won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may either post a notice, or attempt to notify you by email and will take reasonable steps to remedy the breach.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>We may preserve and share your Personal Data in response to a legal request from a competent authority (search warrant, subpoena, court order). We may also preserve and share your Personal Data when we have a good belief that that is necessary for a legitimate purpose: like detecting fraudulent behavior in the App, in order to protect security of the App, and in other cases.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></p>
                            <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
