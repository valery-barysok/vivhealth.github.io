                            <p>Approximately 5 years ago I developed a work stress-related disease - high blood pressure - which is typical for an exec of a fast-paced hi-tech company. <strong>Sleeping poorly at night, low workday energy, irritation at home and work.</strong> Typical symptoms of a typical stressed out manager, right?</p>
                            <p>I was lucky to find a doctor who told it straight: there is no medical substance to treat this disease. <strong>It can be fixed ONLY through lifestyle changes.</strong> I took his advice to heart and started to prep for my first half-marathon. I followed my first race with a marathon, then a half Ironman, and then a full Ironman race. From a focus on movement and activity, I expanded to healthy eating and stress management techniques. <strong>I am well over 50 now, and I no longer have a problem with blood pressure.</strong> Thanks to the lifestyle changes I have made, I feel energetic and ready for action every single day!</p>

                    <p>I participate in several triathlon events every year and finish ahead of many participants half my age. I am passionate about technology and longevity; hence, I decided to start Viv: a company that uses the latest global research and technology to help users slow down the aging process through a series of carefully targeted lifestyle changes.</p>
                    <p>I do not promise that you will complete an Ironman race next year, but <strong>if you follow our advice for just 15 minutes a day, our app will help you become healthier, more energetic, and more satisfied with your appearance.</strong></p>
                    <p>I hope you will find our app useful in helping you make positive lifestyle changes. Please  take a moment to rate our app and give us your suggestions on how we can make it even more useful.</p>
